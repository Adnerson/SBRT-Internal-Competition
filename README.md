# SBRT-Internal-Competition
## Description
Capture the Flag (CTF) is a widely-recognized game that has been played for
centuries all around the world and will be the inspiration for our 2024 Internal
Competition. The main goal of the game is to capture the opposing alliance flags and
bring them back to your own base while protecting your own flags from being
captured. The game will be a 3 versus 3 tournament with an upper bracket and a lower
bracket.
## Overview of code
Within the client folder, a websocket is used to communicate between the joystick
(controlled by arrow keys) and the Raspberri Pi Pico microcontroller (within the 
server folder). Functions including forward, backward, left, and right (as well as the
ability to go forward/backward and turn). 
## Results of competition
Overall, my teammate, Kaden, and I managed to close out the competition undefeated! I
would like to thank Kaden, Stony Brook Robotics E-Board, and friends for their help and 
encouraging words.
